@module(find-dir-stream)
Directory walker like UNIX find(1), for node.js

Lets you find all the files and directories under a given root,
to perform arbitrary operations.

Returns to you a readable stream in object mode, which sends one
object per directory found. The first object is for the root dir.
Subsequent objects are for children, grandchildren, etc., in
breadth-first order.

Each object has two members:
    dir: a string containing the path of a directory
    files: an array containing filenames in that directory

You create a readable stream by passing in the root directory to
the "createObjectStream" function. Then you can read from this stream
in the usual way, for example by handling the "data" event.

Usage:

var ostr = require('find-dir-stream').createObjectStream("/some/path");

ostr.on('data', (obj) => { ...use obj.dir and obj.files array... });
